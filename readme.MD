MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE TEAM PROJECTS.

PROJECT 1: NEST COIN TOKEN with team BlockNinjas

I worked with thhe backend team and we deliberated on how to come up with suitable contract to achieve the task

I personally wrote the unit test for for the nest coin token smart contract


PROJECT 2: NestLibrary with team Wakanda
https://github.com/Shittu24/NestLibrary/blob/test/nestlibrary_hardhat/test/library-test.js

We were tasked to create a smart library that allow users to upload files (public and private), the private files should be shared and the files should be retrieved. 

I also worked with the backend team and we came up with a smart contract to create the library.

I then personally worked on the unit test too although I had some issues verifying some functionalities but I was still able to come up with something from my end.
